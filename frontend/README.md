## Description 

###### The table component is a versatile solution for systematically arranging and displaying data, proving particularly advantageous in scenarios like financial portfolio tracking, academic result summaries, and e-commerce product listings, where organized data presentation aids in easy comparison, assessment, and informed decision-making.

This component serves as a necessary precursor for Day 50, where I will be adding a dynamic table component with sorting functionality, pagination, individual actions, and data exportability.

## Installation 

To use the Table component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder called 'Table' in your project's components directory.
2. Copy the `Table.tsx` and `Table.css` file into the newly created 'Table' folder.
