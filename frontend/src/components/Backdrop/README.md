# Description 

Day 20, one fifth complete of the journey! 
The "Backdrop" component serves to display a blurred, 'pointer-event-less' overlap on the web. Used in nearly all applications, and used in many components including modals, sheets, alerts, and dialogs.

# Installation 

To use the Backdrop component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder called 'Backdrop' in your project's components directory.
2. Copy the `Backdrop.tsx` and `Backdrop.css` files into the newly created 'Backdrop' folder.

# Props 
### Backdrop
`showBackdrop` (required boolean): This property dictates whether the backdrop component should be displayed or not. If true, the backdrop is visible.

`setShowBackdrop` (required function): This is a function that sets the state of the showBackdrop property. It takes a boolean value as argument to toggle the visibility of the Backdrop component.

`darkMode` (optional boolean): This prop controls the theme mode of the backdrop. If set to true, the backdrop will display a dark theme. The default theme is light if this property is set to false or not provided.


# Example Usage
### page.tsx
```jsx
'use client'

import Button from '@/components/Button/Button';
import Backdrop from '@/components/Backdrop/Backdrop';

const BackdropDemo: React.FC = () => {

    const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false)
    const [showBackdrop, setShowBackdrop] = useState(false)

    return (
        <>
            <Button variant='primary' text={isDarkMode ? 'Untoggle dark mode' : 'Toggle dark mode'} handleClick={async () => setIsDarkMode(!isDarkMode)} />
            <Button handleClick={async () => setShowBackdrop(true)} variant='secondary' text='Open Backdrop' />
            <Backdrop darkMode={isDarkMode} showBackdrop={showBackdrop} setShowBackdrop={setShowBackdrop} />;
        </>
)}

export default BackdropDemo;
```
